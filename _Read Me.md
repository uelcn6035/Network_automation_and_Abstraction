# Network Programmability and Automation: A Pythonic Approach

## Abstract
- **Framework Overview**: This dissertation presents a network automation framework designed for geographically distributed networks, integrating open-source tools like Nornir, Scrapli, Napalm, and Zabbix with Python scripts for various network tasks.
- **Architecture & Management**: Utilizes OSPF for routing within branch offices and IPSec tunnels for secure internet connectivity. Implements standardized device management practices to enhance network robustness.
- **Automation Workflow**: Includes configuration updates, testing, backups, and dynamic configuration generation using Jinja2 templates, with robust error handling mechanisms.
- **Study Insights**: Emphasizes the importance of network automation in operational efficiency, management streamlining, and security enhancement.
